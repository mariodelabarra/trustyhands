# trustyhands

trustyhands is an event-driven marketplace application built with **.NET 8**, following a **Vertical Slice Architecture** and powered by **Dapr Sidekick** for resilience, observability, and service-to-service communication.  

The goal of this project is to connect people with trusted local professionals such as electricians, plumbers, and handymen in a unified platform. Customers can post jobs, professionals can offer their services, and the system handles everything from job matching and notifications to payments and reviews.
